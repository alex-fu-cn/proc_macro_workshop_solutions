# proc_macro_workshop_solutions

`https://github.com/dtolnay/proc-macro-workshop` solutions.

This project contains solutions to [dtolnay's proc-macro-workshop](https://github.com/dtolnay/proc-macro-workshop). If I complete all the exercises, the `master` branch will include all the solution source code. Additionally, I have kept separate branches for each exercise, where only the necessary annotations required for the current problem are kept.
